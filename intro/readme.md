# Project 1: Intro

## Welcome to GitHub!
GitHub is pretty cool, and without it [thecrimson.com](https://www.thecrimson.com/) might not even exist as we know it. The first thing you should do is [make an account](https://github.com/join) (if you haven't already); having an account will allow you to a) work on the projects and b) contribute to the Crimson's codebase later on when you graduate from this comp.

### Adding an SSH key
The first step to using GitHub is to add an ssh key to your account. If you don't know or remember what an ssh key is, follow the instructions below.

We need to link the account you just made to your local machine. The ssh key is like the identity of a computer, and it is how GitHub knows whether to trust your machine.

First, open up your terminal. If you're on Windows, we recommend using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) for now.

Next, check to see if you've already generated an SSH key. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).

If you don't have an SSH key, run the command `ssh-keygen` in your terminal and hit Enter a few times, leaving the files blank. Then, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. You should get a string that goes `ssh-rsa [a bunch of characters]`. Copy it.

Go to github.com, click on your user and go to Settings. Click on `SSH and GPG keys` and click on `New SSH key` and paste the key you got into there.

### Fork this repo
Come back to [https://github.com/crimtech/crimtech-comp-f21](https://github.com/crimtech/crimtech-comp-f21). You should see a button on the upper right called "Fork". Click it! Now, you should have your personal copy of this repository.

Next, you need to **clone** this repository onto your machine. Go back to the home directory (folder) of the repo and click on the green `code` option to the upper-right and copy the URL given there. Then, in your terminal, navigate to your desired destination using `cd` and type in `git clone [the url you just received]`. Don't close your terminal yet, we'll need it later!

If you get an error, chances are the SSH key step didn't work. Feel free to do some Googling and reach out if you're stuck!

## Installation Time
We will now install 3 tools that we will use for development during comp: Git, Python and pip.
1. Git (not to be confused with GitHub) is how you'll submit your assignments. It's a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a single piece of software, and it does that by keeping a record of all the changes that have been made to the source code along with who made them and when. GitHub, on the other hand, is an online service where people typically host their repositories.
2. Python is a popular programming language. Its syntax is very similar to pseudo-code, which makes it very readable and a good choice for beginners. In an upcoming project, you'll use Python to create a simple snack game.
3. `pip` is the Python package manager; installing packages allows you to do tons of cool things with Python that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do.

### Install Git
Open up your terminal and type in `git --version`. If you get an error, you need to install Git. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it.

### Install Python
In your terminal, type in `python3 --version`. If you get an error, you need to install Python 3: follow the instructions below.

- If you're using MacOS, you should check out `homebrew`, which is a really useful package manager. The instructions for getting Python with homebrew are [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/). Alternatively, you can download Python from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- If you're using Linux or Windows (PowerShell), enter the command `sudo apt-get install python3.7` in your terminal or download Python 3 from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install `pip`
In your terminal, type `pip --version`. If you get an error, you need to install `pip`. Follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

## Choose a Text Editor!
In order to edit files, you'll need some kind of text editor. Popular options include **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/). You can (technically) use the built-in text editing software like TextEdit for Mac or Notepad for Windows. We don't recommend that though, since you'll miss a lot of features that come with more modern text editors. If you're not sure what to pick and don't already have an editor installed, grab **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**! Olivia used it to edit this file and is a big fan. :)

### Fill out intro.txt
Using whichever editor you want, fill out the questions in the `intro.txt` file!

## Making a Commit
Finished answering the questions? Then it's time to make a commit! First, run `git status` in your terminal. This will show you all the files you have changed in the directory.

Run the command `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "Submit intro"` You should get something that goes `[master ******] Submit intro...`.

At this step, Git may ask you to set your username/email. If so, follow those instructions or call us over if you're confused.

## Push the commit
The change you just made is still only living on your local machine. How do you upload them to GitHub?
Run the command `git push`. Then, go onto your github repository. You should see some changes there!

## Submit
There should be a button now called "pull request" or "make pull request". Click on it!

Put in a title and a description, which can be anything you want. Then, hit "open pull request" or something like that.

Once that's done, you are done! Congratulations on finishing your first lab! That wasn't so bad, was it? It's only gonna get a lot more interesting and fun from here! :D

## Extra Resources
Not familiar with Git? We recommend checking out one or both of the following. If you pursue programming, you will NEED to understand at least the basics of Git, trust us!!!
